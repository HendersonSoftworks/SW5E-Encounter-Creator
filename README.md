# SW5E-Encounter-Creator
A prototype tool for building and running encounters in the SW5E system. It utilises the SW5E API to retrieve the monster data. 

Currently, only the "Create" menu is active. I will add more when I can. 

Features:
1. Click on monsters name to add it to the current encounter
2. To remove a monster, click the "X"
3. Basic Sort and Search functionality
